#### Test PHP Threads

##### How to run ?
```
php index.php
```


I used two threads, Task1 and Task2, to show how the two threads worked.
You can see index.php is end early that Task1 and Task2 are still running.
As you can see, Task1 and Task2 are overlap, it is different from regular php's running.
